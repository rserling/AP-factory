# Ambiguous Productions
This is where we will automate the processing and release of new video files, resulting in a production pipeline.

It is ambitious, adds questionable value and probably a spectacular _Frittering and Wasting of Hours_. But good excersize? 

## Components

Video files are generated from end of manual creation process in Karaoke Builder on Windows (only)

Files are output to Shared Folder on Google Drive

## Dependencies

python 3

ffmpeg

Lingon X (still evaluating)
